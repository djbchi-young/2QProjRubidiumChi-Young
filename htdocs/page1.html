        <h2>Uyghurs: Genocide in Xinjiang</h2>
        <p>Xinjiang is China's largest province located in its West, and although it's located within China, a majority of the population in Xinjiang aren't Han Chinese, the people that make up 90% of China's population. These people are the Uyghurs, a Turkic minority, and although these people are part of China they're culture is more akin to the turkic states to the west of China. But in Xinjiang, there is something sinister being committed.</p>
      <b>The Chinese government is forcefully reducing the Uyghur population in Xinjiang through Concentration camps.</b>
       <p>You may be wondering why they're doing this. Two words. POPULATION CONTROL. The Uyghurs have a vastly different culture from the Majority of Chinese. So if there's someone out there who thinks differently from what the Chinese government wants, let alone an entire group of people, it would greatly affect the population control the Chinese governments wants.</p>
      <p>So how did this all start?</p>
      <p>The Chinese government is rebuilding the silk road through the Belt and Road Initiative which makes it a lot easier for other countries to trade with China. Shown below is a propaganda video used to promote this Initiative</p>

      <p>There is however, one big problem. To build this new silk road, a lot of the connections have to be made through Xinjiang, one of the most important piececs of land needed for the growth of the Chinese economy.</p>
      <p>Over the past few decades, China has been introducing Han Chinese people to Xinjiang. In 1945, 82.7% of the Xinjiang population were Uyghurs, while the Han Chinese were only at 6.2%, but now, the Uyghurs only compose 45%, while the Han Chinese have grown to 42.4%. The government then gave more jobs to the Han than the Uyghurs. So what happened next? The Uyghurs rioted which was perfect for the Chinese government. They put restrictions everywhere, from mass surveillance, to deploying police in every corner of the region. This led to Xinjiang being the birthplace of China's Mass Surveillance, where experiments began to survey every single part of the people in Xinjiang's lives. From going outside to public places, to entering and exiting the region, there were checkpoints everywhere. This then led to these "Vocational Centers" where people who were deemed unsafe were put in Concentration Camps to "combat terrorism".</p>
        <p>What happens in these camps is absolutely revolting. These weren't just places where people were politically indoctrinated, it was a place for people to starve, tortured, and be used as slaves. Prisoners had to sell of their organs to pay off debt, be put in unsanitary and cramped residences to die from disease, and be used as slaves to pick cotton.</p>
        <p>Xinjiang was the beginning of the Chinese government's mass surveillance and social credit system, a place where genocide happens regularly but is covered up <a href="/2QProjRubidiumChi-Young/htdocs/page2.html">with large control in global sources of information. Now ethnic displacement, and mass surveillance, doesn't it seem familiar to you?</a></p>
