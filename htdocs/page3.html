        <h2>TikTok: How to Brainwash Western Youth</h2>
        <p>TikTok was created by ByteDance, a tech startup in Beijing that was founded by Zhang Yiming in 2012. ByteDance specializes in AI technologies. Their first project was a news app called Toutiao. Toutiao's main feature was that all news articles on the app were AI-Generated, no need for reporter, writers, or editors... Except for one. The Chinese government controlled all of the news that was allowed on the app. This AI was groundbreaking and the app reached 10 million users in just 3 months.</p>
        <p>China was obsessed with AI, having AI as their priority research, and ByteDance was focused on creating the most advanced AI technology ever created. And in 2013 China revealed SkyNet, a network of 20 million cameras, with AI face recognition technology to survey the Chinese population. The Chinese government would then use these AI technologies to observe what their population did and then rank them based on surveyed actions.</p>
        <p>But the Chinese government couldn't just stop at China, they needed to expand outward, and what better way to do that but with an addictive, advanced, and viral social media platform.</p>
        <p>So how do you start this platform? In 2016 ByteDance released Douyin to make sure it was effective, and it was. With the help of the advanced AI technology, in less than a year more than 10% of China's population had installed the app.</p>
        <b>It was time for this to go global.</b>
        <p>ByteDance launched TikTok. ByteDance marketed the app to celebrities who would then post their garbage on the app, which would lead to others posting even more garbage on the app. Now that they had gotten users, they needed to keep those users. They needed their users to get addicted.</p>
        <p>Explained below is how TikTok is designed to addict its users.</p>

        <b>This design is neurologically detrimental, and members of generation Z have the lowest attentions spans ever recorded.</b>
        <p>That isn't even the worst of it. Because TikTok gathers an excessive amount of data from its users, and this is why many governments are considering TikTok as a cyberthreat. And they collect a lot more than you think. Your hardware information, network information, location data, the apps you have installed, the sites you visit, and even your keystroke patterns, and this isn't for selling to advertisers, these are used to tap into the wires in your brain.</p>
