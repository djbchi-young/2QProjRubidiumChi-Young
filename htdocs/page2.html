        <h2>Masters of Espionage and Propaganda</h2>
        <b>How do you control the world?</b>
        <p>In today's world, political control isn't gained primarily through military power anymore, political control is gained through information, how much you have, and what information is spread. And in today's day and age the primary source of information can only be one thing: Social Media.</p>
        <p>Let's talk about today's culture first. In most parts of the world, many cultures give individuals freedom of action instead of state control. This is very detrimental to the Chinese government which is run by the Chinese Communist Party. But how did the world get this way? Well this idea of "individualism" was proliferated by the massive influence of countries like the United States of America. So if America can spread their values, how can China? The Chinese government realized one thing. To influence the global population you needed to control what the global population could see, hence, many Chinese companies have large shares in large foreign social media platforms.</p>
        <a href="/2QProjRubidiumChi-Young/htdocs/page3.html"><b>The worst of these platforms is owned by a Chinese company itself.</b></a>
        <p>TikTok is one of the largest social media platforms with over 1 billion monthly active users, and its Chinese counterpart douyin has 600 million monthly active users. This platform has gained a large userbase in recent years and part of the reason why that is, is that the platform was the designed to be as addicting as possible. Not only is this detrimental to the minds of their users, but can and has be used to prevent the flow of information of China's wrongdoings. In 2019 leaked documents showed that TikTok's moderation guidelines stated that videos with references to Tibetan independence or the Tiananmen Square Massacre were to be removed.</p>
        <p>Again, these are not just Chinese companies doing this, but foreign ones as well. Shoe brands like Vans who barred Hong Kong protesters from participating in the Vans Custom Culture competition and Nike removing merchandise from an NBA team after the manager posted an anti-Chinese government tweet, NBA then sparking controversy after said tweet caused Chinese companies to revoke sponsorships. Tech companies like Apple removing an app from the app store which aided Hong Kong protesters track police. There are countless cases of these massive corporations being influenced by China.</p>
      <p>Previously mentioned were cases of China controlling the flow of information, but how does China collect it?</p>
        <p>Other than the countless amounts of data that TikTok collects from its users which TikTok is legally required to hand over to the Chinese Government, The Chinese government has its hands on countless of skilled spies and moles in other national governments and educational institutions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Lieber is the Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, and this professor was caught being a mole for the Wuhan University of Technology since 2011, smuggling research from Harvard to give to the Chinese Government. From 2017 to 2019, Yanqing Ye, a "student" studying at Boston University's Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Biomedical Engineering, was found out to be a spy, being a lieutenant in the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
        <p>China infringes on the right to free speech, and fools people who don't know any better with propaganda, and it is disheartening to see that world leaders and the public are just letting this happen. Doesn't it terrify you?</p>
